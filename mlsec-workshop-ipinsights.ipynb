    "# Using ML with SageMaker and GuardDuty to Identify Anomalous Traffic\n",

    "## Using IP Insights to score security findings\n",
    "-------\n",
    "[Return to the workshop instructions](https://ml-threat-detection.awssecworkshops.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker IP Insights is an unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm for susicipous IP addresses that uses statistical modeling and neural networks to capture associations between online resources (such as account IDs or hostnames) and IPv4 addresses. Under the hood, it learns vector representations for online resources and IP addresses.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "As a result, if the vector representing an IP address and an online resource are close together, then it is likely (not surprising) for that IP address to access that online resource, even if it has never accessed it before.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we use the Amazon SageMaker IP Insights algorithm to train a model using the `<principal ID, IP address`> tuples we generated from the CloudTrail log data, and then use the model to perform inference on the same type of tuples generated from GuardDuty findings to determine how unusual it is to see a particular IP address for a given principal involved with a finding.\n",
    "\n",
    "After running this notebook, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- obtain, transform, and store data for use in Amazon SageMaker,\n",
    "- create an AWS SageMaker training job to produce an IP Insights model,\n",
    "- use the model to perform inference with an Amazon SageMaker endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like to know more, please check out the [SageMaker IP Inisghts Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/ip-insights.html).\n",

    "## Setup\n",
    "------\n",
    "*This notebook was created and tested on a ml.m4.xlarge notebook instance. We recommend using the same, but other instance types should still work.*\n",

    "The following is a cell that contains Python code.  It can be run in two ways:  \n",
    "1. Selecting the cell (click anywhere inside it), and then clicking the button above labelled \"Run\".  \n",
    "2. Selecting the cell (click anywhere inside it), and typing Shift+Return on your keyboard.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When a cell is running, you will see a star(\\*\\) in the brackets to the left (e.g., `In [*]`), and when it has completed you will see a number in the brackets. Each click of \"Run\" will execute the next cell in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go ahead and click **Run** now. You should see the text in the `print` statement get printed just beneath the cell.\n",
    "\n",

    "So, what do we do? A common approach is to train with two types of data: data that is known \"normal\" and data that is known malicious.  If we have both, we can compare the scores of the two to find a good cut-off.  (Of course, known malicious data can be hard to come by.  In the full IPInsight tutorial, you can learn about a simple method for simulating malicious web traffic.)  \n",

    "\n",
